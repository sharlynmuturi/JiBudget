# JiBudget - Personal Finance & Budgeting App

Jibudget is a personal finance web application I built to better understand how people track money in real life, not just how budgeting tools assume they do.

The goal was to create something practical, simple to use, and flexible enough to reflect real spending behavior.

## Why I Built This
From working with financial and insurance data, I saw how often people struggle with:
- keeping consistent budgeting habits
- understanding where money actually goes
- reacting to overspending too late

This project grew from a learning exercise into a full system focused on clarity, feedback, and automation.

## Key Features
- Income and expense tracking with categories and subcategories  
- Monthly budgets with visual breakdowns  
- Multiple wallets/accounts support  
- Savings goals with progress tracking  
- Recurring transactions (e.g. salary, subscriptions)   
- Clean, modal-based onboarding and forms  

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django (Python)  
- **Frontend:** Django templates, Bootstrap, JavaScript  
- **Database:** Relational database design (MySQL)
